**L2s for Move VM.**

## :warning: Important Disclaimer

The M2 repository is currently **deprecated** as we are in the process of a major redesign. This is to enhance and integrate with the forthcoming Movement SDK, which promises to deliver an even more robust and flexible ecosystem for our users. We appreciate your understanding and are excited to share the new features soon!

## Introduction

The Move programming language poses numerous benefits to builders including direct interaction with digital assets through custom resource types, flexibility with transaction script declaration, on-chain verification, and bytecode safety privileges.

Movement M2 is an ecosystem of Layer 2 technologies for developing L2 smart contracts.

This repository contains the code and contributor documentation for M2. If you would like to learn how to use and develop for the platform, please visit [docs.movementlabs.xyz](docs.movementlabs.xyz).

## Features

Currently, M2 consists of...
- `sov-aptosvm`: a [Sovereign Labs](https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk) rollup of Aptos VM using [Celestia DA](https://docs.celestia.org/concepts/how-celestia-works/data-availability-layer/).
- `sov-movevm`: a [Sovereign Labs](https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk) rollup of Move VM using [Celestia DA](https://docs.celestia.org/concepts/how-celestia-works/data-availability-layer/).
- `sov-monovm`: a [Sovereign Labs](https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk) rollup combining both `sov-aptosvm` and `sov-movevm` namespaces using [Celestia DA](https://docs.celestia.org/concepts/how-celestia-works/data-availability-layer/).
  - Currently, the `sov-monovm` testnet is served at [testnet.sov-monovm.mvlabs.net](testnet.sov-monovm.mvlabs.net). As it is under heavy development, outages are common. Check our status page for known outages.

## Installation

See [docs.movementlabs.xyz](docs.movementlabs.xyz) for a more complete installation guide. We recommend working with our Docker containers or using our installer.

## Usage

Once you've installed our platform, the easiest way to get started developing is to use the CLI to test code locally and publish to our testnet.

```bash
# test
movement move test --sov-aptosvm

# compile and publish
movement move compile && movement move publish --sov-aptosvm
```
